    "text": "Food production\nFood production areas tends to be well covered in urban areas of well-developed cities. For instance in Lyon the food production areas seem to be well accounted for in OSM.\nOn the other hand, the information that some land is dedicated to food production is often lacking in rural areas and less-developed cities. For instance, in Cairo, although it is obvious that much of the territory corresponds to farmland, the OSM coverage of “landuse-farmland” is far from exhaustive.\nThis information about food production will likely be one of the most straightforward outputs of the GloUrb remote sensing (RS) tasks. It could hence be interesting to compare how physical (RS) data and crowdsourced (OSM) data compare to each other on that matter."

Besides, their occurrence in the OSM crowdsourced dataset is in itself a sign that these areas are used for recreational use.\nFor some less-developed cities though (e.g. Bamako, Bangui), very few items falling under this label occur: this might be in part due to false negatives (i.e. these items exist but they are not registered in OSM), but it might be difficult to assert this with certainty. Maybe exploring city planning documents will provide us with data related to urban equipment for comparison. Note that for Bamako, for instance, the occurrence of drinking water points is not indicative of a recreational use of the areas, but a sign that the availability of safe drinking water in that area is or has been problematic and is being or has been addressed, possibly by NGOs."

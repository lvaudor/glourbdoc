# URLs

The dataframe presented in the app corresponds to the **100 first results** returned by a **SERP (Search Engine Results Page) API** in English ("en"), for country "US" (see how this parameter can or should be changed).

For now the words presented on the left do not correspond to the scraped contents of the pages but simply to the **"snippet" column of the table** which corresponds to the preview of the page in the search engine. We tried to distinguish common names and "geographical names" (names starting with a capitalized letter though not at the beginning of a sentence): this should be improved (for instance by removing names of months).
